F2 â€” Command-line bulk renaming tool [version v1.9.0]

Usage: FLAGS [OPTIONS] [PATHS TO FILES AND DIRECTORIES...]
or: FIND [REPLACE] [PATHS TO FILES AND DIRECTORIES...]

F2 helps you organise your filesystem through batch renaming.
The simplest usage is to do a basic find and replace:

$ f2 -f Screenshot -r Image
+--------------------+---------------+--------+
|       INPUT        |    OUTPUT     | STATUS |
+--------------------+---------------+--------+
| Screenshot (1).png | Image (1).png | ok     |
| Screenshot (2).png | Image (2).png | ok     |
| Screenshot (3).png | Image (3).png | ok     |
+--------------------+---------------+--------+

The argument to -f is the find string, while the one to -r is the
replacement string. The current directory is used by default, but
you can pass relative or absolute paths to other files and
directories.

F2 supports many command-line options. Use the --help flag to examine
the full list. For extensive usage examples, visit the project wiki:
